The following bash scripts can be run from the command line. They are numbered in the order I use them.

1. options - Installs Optional packages - 
	"xclip terminator vim chromium quassel" -TODO fix dropbox install
        

2. first - Installs required packages and programs -  
	"gcc, g++, git, gdb, automake, make, libreadline-gplv2-dev "
	"libncurses5-dev, libneon27, libaprutil1-dev, libtool "
	"openjdk-6-jre, openjdk-6-jre-headless, libgtest-dev, screen "
	"Lua-5.1 - Berkely DB 5.0 - MySQL Server and Workbench"

3. start - Initial setup of development environment - 
	# Choose editor
	# Setup git user.* config
	# Setup ssh key
	# Register on gerrit
	# Test Gerrit setup
	# Clone repos and checkout a local branch of Core3 origin/unstable
	# Symlinks
	# Engine library
	# MySQL database checks
	# Server configuration
	# Tre files
	# build config; run_dev;

4. build - build always does make -k build
	build config does 'make config' and 'make clean'
	build clean does 'make clean'

5. run_dev - Build and run the development server and launch it under gdb on a 'screen'
	***NOTE: run_dev uses gdb in batch mode and starts with the commands
	in ~/run/run_gdb which you can change to your pleasing;
	(breakpoints, dumps, settings etc.)

The following scripts are also useful...

myip -  display the ip of the VM and login port for quick configuration of the windows client

updateip - Get ip address of local eth0 and update galaxy table as needed

latest - do a quick git-stash, git-pull, and git-stash-apply so you can get to the latest code w/o loosing local work

freeze - Save your devenv state so you can repeat the same tests over and over

thaw - allow server to continue from previous state each time you run it

installed - Package and version check sent to /home/*
